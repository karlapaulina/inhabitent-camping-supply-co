# Inhabitent - Project 4

A custom WordPress theme with custom plugins for an e-commerce site.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Download me (don't clone me!)

```
Then add me to your wp-content directory.
```

2. Install the dev dependencies

```
Next you'll need to run npm install inside your theme directory next to install the node modules you'll need for Gulp, etc.
```

3. Update the proxy in gulpfile.js

```
Lastly, be sure to update your gulpfile.js with the appropriate URL for the Browsersync proxy (so change localhost[:port-here]/[your-dir-name-here] to the appropriate localhost URL).
```
